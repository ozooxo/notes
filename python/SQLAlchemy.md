# SQLAlchemy Notes

SQLAlchemy is a python ORM framework.

Compare to Django which does ORM but also web (controller, viewer) parts, SQLAlchemy is just a ORM framework. Also, (compare to Django which helps you to generate all SQL code, doing SQL migration, and hide all SQL from the user) SQLAlchemy seems working better if you have your own SQL schema.
