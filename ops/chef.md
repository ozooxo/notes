# Chef Notes

+ A configuration management technology
+ A set of automation tools

Automating the following aspects:

+ `Chef`: Infrastructure automation
    + Define infrastructure policy as code
+ `InSpec`: Compliance automation 
    + For compliance/security process
    + Translating compliance policies to code
+ `Habitat`: Applications automation 

Approaches:

+ Test
+ Repair

Features:

+ Build infrastructure as code
    + Pros: more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.
+ Cloud integration (for distributing infrastructure on multi-cloud environment): 
    + Through `knife` utility.

3-tier client server model:

+ Workstation: 
    + Configuration and development. Manage server remotely using `Chef`
    + The OS doesn't need to be the same as the Chef server.
+ Chef server:
    + Central repository of the Chef code
        + Development under `Chef DK`
    + Save information about every node 
    + May use `Chef automate` to (1) host the Chef server, (2) provide automated build pipelines.
+ Node:
    + Actual machines managed by Chef server.
    + May have different configurations.
    + Run `chef-client` which downloads/runs the code from the Chef server to bring itself up-to-date configurations.
        + Modes:
            + Chef clients shall be setup in "daemon mode", to run per-... period of time.
            + For simplification/testing reasons, `chef-client` may be run in the so-called `--local-mode` to apply chef code on the Chef server.
        + `chef-client` does test and repair, i.e., if the content didn't change, the configuration will not be modified again. Also, Chef restored the original configuration if it is being changed from the outside.

Other associated modules/tools:

+ `knife`: Chefâ€™s command-line tool to interact with the Chef server from the workstation.
+ `solo`: allow guest machines to use Chef cookbooks without any Che client/server configuration.
+ Chef-shell: local interactive session for simple testing (before the remote testing/debugging with long feedback cycle).
+ Foodcritic: Flagging in Chef cookbook.
+ `ChefSpec`: Simulate a Chef run. Mostly used for TDD/unit test.
+ `Test Kitchen`: Chef's integrated testing framework. Provide a temporary environment that helps to run and test cookbooks.

Components:

+ Cookbook: created by (1) chef command, (2) knife utility
+ Role: a logically way to group nodes.
    + Example roles: web server/database server/load balancer...
+ Environment: 
    + Example environments: development/testing/production/...

Component relationship:

+ A **cookbook** contains multiple **recipes**.
+ A **recipe** contains multiple **resources**.
+ A **cookbook** contain multiple **attributes** for basic settings.
+ A **resource** may be a static **files**, a non-static **templates** (in `.ebr` format), or a package which will be later on placed on the nodes.
+ Metadata of the developed package (names, ...) are saved in **metadata.rb**.

## Overlap with/competitors

+ Puppet: deliver and operating software.
+ Ansible: automation/deployment.
+ SaltSatck: data-driven configuration/infrastructure management.
